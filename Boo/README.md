## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You'll need a .NET Runtime for Boo.
* On Windows, install [Microsoft's .NET Runtime](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa496123.aspx).
* On Linux, install [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/).

You'll also need to download the latest release of Boo.
* [Latest Release Of Boo](https://github.com/boo-lang/boo/archive/master.zip).

### Running Hello World in Boo
In the command prompt, find the downloaded Boo folder from the previous step
and navigate to the bin folder.  

From the bin subdirectory, run the following command (pointing to the location of
the `hello-world.boo` file located in this repository):

`booi path-to-repository/Boo/hello-world.boo`

That's it! If all goes well you will see "Hello, World!" printed in the command
prompt.  If you run into any issues along the way, check out the documentation
[here](https://github.com/boo-lang/boo/wiki/Getting-Started).
